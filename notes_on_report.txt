Introduction: 
Introduce Diffusion

Show that diffusion learns manifolds. 

Show Swiss Roll. Describe function that creates Introduce
- Show graph


Show that the swiss roll has an orthnormal basis that is tangent and normal to the swiss roll
- Show graph of the plane and normal



Show that we can approx this by doing KNN and local PCA. 
- Show the angle distance between the planes and normal with this technique for different k (num neighbours)

Explain diffusion model. 
Show that we are now adding ansitropic noise 
- Show graph of isotropic noise
- Show graph of ansitropic noise

Show results:



Taking out the tangent noise... 


Introduce Diffusion 
- Show poached images on diffusion 
Claim: Diffusion learns manifold

What we do: Can we use a technique that "learns manifold" to improve diffusion? 

How noise is added in standard diffuion 
- Show isotropic covariance. 
- Show image of isotropic noise in 3D
- SOME MATH

We learn "tangent and normal" at a point using knn 
- Show image of tangent and normal at some points on swiss roll.

- KNN PCA -> Have an equation that shows this...

Show example of noising process with ansitropic noise 
- Show images of all tangent, all normal, and some weighted version. 

- HAVE MATCH FOR THIS.

Show results.


Future Steps: 
- Embed swiss roll in higher dimensions.
- Torus or other known manifolds? 
- New metrics: Generated Sample Spread?
- Images? 
- Convert images to vectors. Do the KNN local pca there and then see what happens.
